# DocoGPT
### What is DocoGPT?
- DocoGPT is a platform for document analysis, summarization, and Q&A using Retrieval-Augmented Generation with LLMs.
- We also build a simple frontend for DocoGPT, below is an example of what DocoGPT achieved.

### Design for DocoGPT
- DocoGPT is aimed to achieve higher accuracy in finding answers related to userâ€™s question in the vector database by employing a hierarchical information architecture. 
- Instead of embedding the document content as a whole, DocoGPT use GPT-4 to split documents into sections and create summaries, building a document tree where document sections forms the leaf nodes and parent nodes are summaries of their children.

### Known Issues
- Time-consuming tree construction, if the document is big. We recommend document of size 1 - 8 pages.
- High token consumption, related to the previous issue.
- PDF parsing sometime don't work.
